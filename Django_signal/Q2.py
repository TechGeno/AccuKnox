Yes, In Django signals are typically run in the same thread as the caller by default.

#Code example:

import threading  
from django.db import models  
from django.db.models.signals import post_save  
from django.dispatch import receiver  

# Define a Django model 'MyModel' with one field 'name'
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)  

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_receiver(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    # Get the thread ID of the current thread in which the signal is executed
    receiver_thread_id = threading.get_ident()
    print(f"Signal receiver running in thread: {receiver_thread_id}")


def create_model_instance():
    # Get the thread ID of the thread running this function (sender thread)
    sender_thread_id = threading.get_ident()
    print(f"Sender running in thread: {sender_thread_id}")
    # Create an instance of 'MyModel'to trigger  the 'post_save' signal
    obj = MyModel.objects.create(name="Test")
    print(f"Sender thread after signal: {threading.get_ident()}")


create_model_instance()

Code Explanation
Intialls we define a simple MyModel with a name field.
Then we create a signal receiver function my_signal_receiver that prints the thread ID it's running in.
Following this , iIn the create_model_instance function, we:
Print the thread ID before creating the model instance, to check the thread on which it's running on .
Then, we create a new MyModel instance, triggering the post_save signal
To check , we print the thread ID again after the signal has been processed.
When we run create_model_instance(), if the signals run in the same thread, we should see the same thread ID printed for all three print statements.
